I am a PhD student in the University of Durham, working on developing new AGN feedback subgrid models for cosmological simulations. I am currently studying UV line-driven winds from Supermassive Black Hole accretion discs as a potential major feedback channel. 

I am also interested in applications of Deep Learning to a wide variety of areas, from medical imaging, to social sciences and aviation.
