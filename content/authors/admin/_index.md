I have recently obtained a PhD in Astrophysics by the University of Durham and I'm currently holding a postdoctoral research position at the Computer Science department of the University of Oxford. I'm interested in any kind of system which requires large computational resources to understand.

My current focus is on designing new algorithms for the calibration of large agent-based models.
